                <p>At the age of eight, Phoebe transitioned to Diamondz School of Dance, eager to broaden her skill set and explore new styles. Under the guidance of Abbie, a dedicated coach known for her emphasis on both technical excellence and mental well-being, Phoebe flourished in an environment that nurtured both her talent and confidence. She expanded her repertoire to include Musical Theatre, Street, Contemporary, and Performers, each style adding a new dimension to her artistry and versatility. The supportive and encouraging atmosphere at Diamondz allowed her to develop not only as a dancer but also as a well-rounded performer, gaining valuable stage experience and a deeper understanding of expressive movement. Through Abbie’s mentorship and a strong focus on mental health awareness, Phoebe learned the importance of resilience, self-belief, and emotional expression in dance—qualities that continue to shape her journey today.</p>

                <p>In early 2023, at just 13 years old, Phoebe took a significant step in her dance and cheerleading journey by joining Empire Elite All Stars, a highly competitive team known for its rigorous training and high-performance standards. Embracing the challenge, she quickly adapted to the demands of competitive cheerleading and dance, excelling in Level 2 Cheerleading, Street, Pom, and Lyrical. Her commitment to refining her technique and strengthening her performance skills paid off, and by 2024, she advanced to Level 3 Cheerleading, demonstrating not only her athleticism but also her leadership and teamwork.

                    A defining moment in her career came when she played a crucial role in helping her team secure the prestigious Grand National Championship title at Bournemouth Future Cheer—a testament to her dedication and ability to thrive under pressure. That same year, Phoebe’s growing reputation in the industry led to her acceptance into Team England’s Freestyle Pom Development Squad, an incredible opportunity that allows her to train alongside some of the country’s most promising athletes. Traveling to Telford every six weeks, she refines her technique, builds strength, and gains invaluable experience at a national level.</p>

                <p>Throughout 2024 and into 2025, Phoebe’s dedication to both cheerleading and dance continued to drive her forward. She remained a fierce competitor in Cheer City and Legacy Cheer and Dance, showcasing her skills on some of the biggest stages. A highlight of this period came when she and her team achieved victory at the Birmingham NEC in the highly competitive Level 3 U16s Cheerleading division, solidifying her reputation as a standout performer.

                    However, as Phoebe's passion for dance deepened, she made the decision to step away from competitive cheerleading to fully dedicate herself to her training at Elizabeth Boardman in Peterborough. This shift marked an exciting new chapter in her journey, allowing her to refine her artistry and focus on technical excellence. Now, she is committed to advancing her skills in Modern dance while working towards graded levels. Her training spans multiple disciplines, including Senior Street, Senior Street Team (Dance Company), Grade 7 Modern, Grade 6 Ballet, Senior Tech (Dance Company), Senior Contemporary, and Senior Contemporary Team (Dance Company).
                    
                    With each new challenge, Phoebe continues to evolve as a performer, proving that her journey is only just beginning. Her relentless passion, determination, and willingness to push boundaries set her apart, and as she moves forward, the possibilities for her future in dance are limitless.</p>
